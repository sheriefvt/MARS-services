This is the code base for MARS network services.

The current name of this code is MARS.

There are two versions V1 and V2.

V1 was done for use with EDISON, but is intended to be more general. V2 has more features but not deployed yet.


Each version has two sub-directories:

Source code

doc
------
Latex manual, covering, among other things, high level design, installation, build, execution (startup), configuration files, shutdown, etc.
